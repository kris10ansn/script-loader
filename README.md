# Script Loader chrome extension

Popup chrome extension that allows one to save and run scripts on websites. Made with react.

## How it works

Popup (react, src folder) communicates with contentScript.js (plain javascript, public folder) to run code in current window

## What i learned

- Got more familiar with React
- Got more familiar with chrome extensions and contentscripts in particular (communication between popup and contentscripts)
